# novusphere-db> A MongoDB based database api for interacting with data indexed from a blockchain## Recommended Tools[.NET Core Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/)[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)[MongoDB Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/)## NotesAfter running for the first time a file/folder will be created called `data/config.json` by default, novusphere-db is not set up to use the `Novusphere.EOS` plugin. To configure this, you edit the `config.json` to tell novusphere-db where to load the plugin from:```javascript  "Plugins": [    "bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/Novusphere.EOS.dll"  ]```You must also enable access to the collection `eosforum`:```javascript    "Collection": [ "eosforum" ],```On 8/23/2018 the forum was migrated to use the `eosforumdapp` contract. A snapshot of the state of the database using the `eosforumtest` is provided below. This should be imported before running `novusphere-db`.**SHA-256:** b346fbd129b8b1c2360917618ed28825a65d57a7adde8cda15ec49d3a7c9624e`**Download:** https://cdn.novusphere.io/static/eosforumtest-8-23-2018.json
